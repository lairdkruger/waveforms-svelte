Basic idea:

1. Draw a line from a set of points using the vertex shader

2. Pass the waveform/spectrum data as an attribute to the shader

3. Use the data to shape the line into the waveform 

4. Extend to other shapes and even 3D spheres etc

Spheres:

Probably just use a normal sphere object
Hard job is to work out the vertex groups, I'd say group into horizontal bands, and vertical bands
Will potentially have to combine with a simple noise shader to get effective visuals


FBOS?

No need yet, since no positional data is calculated in shader side, it all just comes from the AudioAnalyzer object.
