We need to change the way that signals are structured

At the moment, they have a signalID which is supposed to identify the signal,
This ID is uploaded to the db and is used to select the correct signal function from the store.

But this should be the job of a functionId, while the signalId should be used to identify the signal itself.
Even though controls only have one signal per control for now, we should make this scalable:
The signalId field could be:

	controlId_signal_signalId
	eg: bloomThreshold_signal_main


Then ideally this is what we should do:

Signal function fields should be extended to objects with the following structure

function: {
  type: 'audio' | 'midi',	// so we know which store to use when fetching the signal getter functions
  id: 'functionId',	// used for fetching correct signal functions from stores (eg: get36_note_launchkeyMk261LaunchkeyMidi)
  output: NumberFunction | BooleanFunction
}

The function type and id fields would be uploaded to db, and could be used to select correct signal output function on setup


EXTRA TODO:

Potentially need to scrap the distinction between boolean and number controls.
It's a headache:
Instead just insert a number -> boolean converter function in the signal chain where required
